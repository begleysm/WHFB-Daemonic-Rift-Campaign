# WHFB-Daemonic-Rift-Campaign
Games Workshop Warhammer Fantasy Battles Daemonic Rift Campaign

This repository is a Campaign for Warhammer Fantasy Battle, 8th edition, based on [Adam Sweeny](https://github.com/adsweeny)'s [WFB-Campaigns repository](https://github.com/adsweeny/WFB-Campaigns).

I did the following to "update" the repository.
1. Remove content that was specific to Adam's gaming group & their experience playing the campaign
2. Convert the site to raw HTML (from Cold Fusion)

Simply download the repo and open index.html to start learning about the campaign that Adam developed.

This [campaign](https://tcrepo.com/downloads/daemonic-rift-campaign/) is now hosted at my new site, [Tabletop Campaign Repository](https://tcrepo.com).  It's a 100% free, no ad, community resource site to host homebrew narrative, campaign, scenario, tournament, & event material for tabletop miniature war games such as Warhammer 40k, Age of Sigmar, Warhammer Fantasy Battle, and more.  Check it out!
