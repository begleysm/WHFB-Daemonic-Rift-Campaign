# WHFB-Daemonic-Rift-Campaign
Games Workshop Warhammer Fantasy Battles Daemonic Rift Campaign

This repository is a Campaign for Warhammer Fantasy Battles based on [Adam Sweeny](https://github.com/adsweeny)'s [WFB-Campaigns repository](https://github.com/adsweeny/WFB-Campaigns).

I did the following to "update" the repository.
1. Remove content that was specific to Adam's gaming group & their experience playing the campaign
2. Convert the site to raw HTML (from Cold Fusion)

Simply download the repo and open index.html to start learning about the campaign that Adam developed.
